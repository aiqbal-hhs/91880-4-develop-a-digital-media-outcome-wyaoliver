    <h1>Chessboxing</h1>
    <img src="chessboxing.jpg" class="center" width="460" height="330" alt="Chessboxing">
<p>Chess boxing, or chessboxing is a hybrid sport that combines two traditional sports: chess and boxing. Contestants compete in alternating rounds of chess and boxing.
    The rules in chess boxing are simple, There are 11 rounds and players alternate between boxing and chess, The boxing rounds last three minutes and the chess rounds last four, You win by knockout or checkmate.</p>
    <h1>Origin</h1>
<p>The sport of chess boxing was invented in 1992 by the French artist Enki Bilal, who thought it up for his comic book, Froid Équateur. It would take more than a decade for the sport to appear in real life, but in 2003 the first official bout was held in Berlin.
    Today there are chess boxers around the world. In the United States, Andrew McGregor is one of the biggest local names. Based in Los Angeles, McGregor is a photographer, filmmaker and founder of the Los Angeles Chessboxing Club.</p>
    <h1>How to play Chessboxing</h1>
    <p>The object of chess boxing is to either beat your opponent in alternate rounds of chess or boxing. Matches can be won from either discipline with the chess coming down to check mate or forfeit and the boxing in either a stoppage or points decision. 
        Players go head to head in chess boxing and the match starts with a four minute round of chess. The players then go into the ring for a three minute round of boxing before again returning to the chess board. The match consists of 11 rounds in all (6 rounds of chess and 5 rounds of boxing) with 1 minute intervals between rounds.
        <br> 
        <br>

Each player has boxing gloves which are removed for the chess round. Head phones are given to the players when taking part in chess so not hear advice from the audience. The chess side of the game is played out over a 12 minute clock and is essentially ‘speed chess’. Officials may step in if they believe a player to be stalling in the chess rounds to force them into a move within 10 seconds. 
        <br>
        <br>
    The boxing rounds are scored as per a normal boxing match on points. Unless the chess game has seen a conclusion – and this is very rare in the sport – then the game will go to count back on boxing points. In the event that the boxing is a draw then the win will go to the player playing the black chess pieces.
    To win you must either gain check mate or receive a withdrawal from the chess game. Alternatively you can knock your opponent out in boxing or win on points to receive the win if the chess is a draw.</p>
